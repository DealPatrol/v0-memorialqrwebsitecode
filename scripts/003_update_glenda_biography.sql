SET biography = 'A life so beautifully lived deserves to be beautifully remembered. Today, we gather not only in sorrow but in profound gratitude for the extraordinary woman we were blessed to know—Glenda Jane Kelso.

Glenda was the heart of her home and a force of nature in the lives of all who knew her. She left this world as she lived in it: on her own terms, with a quick wit, and likely planning a joke we have yet to discover. For 57 years, she was the devoted and loving partner to her husband, Lynn. She was a selfless homemaker who dedicated her life to her children, Eddie and Penny, and to countless others she welcomed into her heart and home as her own.

To know Glenda was to be loved fiercely, laugh loudly, and feel truly spoiled. She was a woman of beautiful contrasts: patient and kind, yet tough as nails. Her fanatic sense of humor was a light that could cut through the hardest days, and her legendary chocolate gravy was a taste of her deep, abiding love. She never let anyone forget who was really in charge, but she also never wavered in her loyalty, sticking by her family even when the world said no.

Glenda found pure joy in the magic of the ordinary, especially when it brought smiles to the faces of children. She delighted in dressing up for holidays, with Halloween holding a special place in her heart, creating moments of wonder that will be cherished forever. Her happiness was found in the noisy, loving chaos of being surrounded by family, though the steady chatter of the police scanner was a close second.

She was a curator of joy, a teller of hard truths, and the unwavering glue that held her family together through good times and bad. Glenda''s love was a vibrant tapestry woven with threads of laughter, music, fierce protection, and an occasional, loving dose of stubbornness.

We are certain that her reunion in Heaven with her beloved mother, Desmer, is filled with laughter and a heavenly plan to keep a loving, watchful eye on us all.

Glenda''s incredible legacy lives on in her husband, Lynn; her children, Eddie Kelso and Penny Collins; her cherished grandchildren, Cole Collins, Kristin Kelso, Gracie Dean, Braxton Phillips, Weston Green, Addalynn Rassman, Wrenley Hunter, and Ridge Thompson; her beautiful French daughter-in-love, Caroline; her god-sent angels, Colton, Anzlie, and Remi; her children of the heart, Savannah (Bo) Pitts, Bama Thompson, Taylor (Kelly) Hunter, and Jordan Thompson; and her special friends.

We are fortunate, blessed, and endlessly grateful to have been loved by her. Though our hearts are broken and we will miss her beyond measure, we find comfort in knowing that her spirit—her laughter, her love, and her legendary chocolate gravy—will forever be a part of us.

The family extends their deepest gratitude to the compassionate staff at Cullman Regional Medical Center, Folsom Center Nursing Home, Cullman Dialysis Clinic, and Southern Care Hospice for the dignity, kindness, and peace they provided in her final days.'
